        "Generative artificial intelligent (AI) models like Gemma are effective at a variety of tasks. You can further fine-tune Gemma models with domain-specific data to perform tasks such as sentiment analysis. However, full fine-tuning of generative models by updating billions of parameters is resource intensive, requiring specialized hardware, such as GPUs, processing time, and memory to load the model parameters.\n",

        "[Low Rank Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) (LoRA) is a fine-tuning technique which greatly reduces the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks by freezing the weights of the model and inserting a smaller number of new weights into the model. This technique makes training with LoRA much faster and more memory-efficient, and produces smaller model weights (a few hundred MBs), all while maintaining the quality of the model outputs. This tutorial walks you through using Keras to perform LoRA fine-tuning on a Gemma model."
